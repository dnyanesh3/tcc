 Studying the features of the GAE PaaS model.
Google App Engine (GAE) is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering from Google that
allows developers to build and run applications on Google's infrastructure. Some key features of GAE include:

•	Automatic scaling: GAE automatically scales your application based on the amount of incoming traffic,
so you don't have to worry about provisioning or managing the underlying resources.

•	High availability: GAE provides built-in redundancy for your application, so it
can automatically recover from failures and continue serving traffic.

•	Easy deployment: GAE provides an easy-to-use command-line tool for deploying and managing your application,
and you can also use the Google Cloud Console to monitor and update your application.

•	Programming languages: GAE supports several programming languages, including Java, Python, Go, and PHP, 
so you can choose the language that best suits your needs.

•	Datastore: GAE includes a NoSQL datastore based on Google's Bigtable technology, which allows you to store
and retrieve large amounts of data with low latency. You can also use other storage options like Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner and Cloud Datastore(Firestore)

•	APIs and services: GAE also provides a number of APIs and services that you can use in your application,
such as the Google Cloud Translation API, Google Cloud Vision API, and Google Cloud Speech API.

•	Security: GAE provides secure environment with automatic updates and easy access management.

Keep in mind that GAE has some limitations and restrictions, such as a limit on the amount of resources 
that can be consumed by a single application and restrictions on the types of processes that can be run
on the platform. But for most of the use cases it will work great
Overall, GAE is a powerful platform that makes it easy to build, deploy, and 
scale web applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.
